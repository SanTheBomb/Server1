# Server1

(I managed to break a few things and just realized so I will be fixing those)

This is my first server and it is hosted on port 8080. It was made using Golang following a tutorial (https://blog.logrocket.com/creating-a-web-server-with-golang/). Feel free to modify it, make it better, (or just make a monstrosity), and show me. 

Modifications:
  Added some notes when booting in the console

Note: It doesn't actually record the name field and the address field
