# Server1
This is my first server script. It was made using Golang following a tutorial (https://blog.logrocket.com/creating-a-web-server-with-golang/). Feel free to modify it, make it better, (or just make a monstrosity), and show me. 

Modifications:
  Added some notes when booting in the console

Note: It doesn't actually record the name field and the address field into a spreadsheet for later use. They are varibles set in that session and deleted when the session is terminated by Ctrl-C
